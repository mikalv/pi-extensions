/**
 * amux — Task State Machine (pure)
 *
 * Declares task lifecycle transition rules, ownership validation, and
 * notification intent as explicit data. Pure module — no I/O, no side
 * effects, no filesystem access. All functions are synchronous.
 *
 * SPEC-19 Slice 1: the six existing lifecycle service functions in
 * `task-service.ts` delegate their pre-flight status/ownership checks
 * to this module. Behavior is preserved — error messages, mutation,
 * reservations, activity entries, and notifications are unchanged.
 *
 * SPEC-19 Slice 2: transition definitions also own activity text metadata
 * and side-effect descriptors (availability/reservation behavior). Services
 * still execute the effects explicitly; this module remains pure.

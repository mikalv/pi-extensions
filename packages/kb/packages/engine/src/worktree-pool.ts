/**
 * A pool of idle git worktrees that can be recycled across tasks.
 *
 * When `recycleWorktrees` is enabled, completed task worktrees are returned
 * to this pool instead of being deleted. New tasks acquire a warm worktree
 * from the pool, preserving build caches (node_modules, target/, dist/).
 *
 * The pool only tracks *idle* worktrees — those not currently assigned to
 * any active task. The scheduler's `maxWorktrees` setting still governs
 * the total number of worktrees (active + idle).
 *
 * **Lifecycle across restarts:** The pool is in-memory only, but on engine
 * startup it can be rehydrated from disk state via {@link rehydrate} and
 * {@link scanIdleWorktrees}. When `recycleWorktrees` is true, the startup
 * sequence scans the `.worktrees/` directory, identifies idle worktrees
 * (those not assigned to any active task), and bulk-loads them into the
 * pool. When `recycleWorktrees` is false, orphaned worktrees are cleaned
 * up via {@link cleanupOrphanedWorktrees}.

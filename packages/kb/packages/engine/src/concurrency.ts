/**
 * A concurrency semaphore that gates all agentic activities (triage specification,
 * task execution, and merge operations) behind a shared slot limit.
 *
 * The semaphore ensures that the total number of concurrently running AI agents
 * never exceeds `maxConcurrent`, regardless of which subsystem spawned them.
 *
 * **Priority-based draining:** When a slot becomes available and multiple agents
 * are waiting, the waiter with the highest `priority` value is served first.
 * Among waiters with the same priority, FIFO order is preserved. The built-in
 * priority constants are:
 *
 * - {@link PRIORITY_MERGE} (`2`) — merge agents (highest)
 * - {@link PRIORITY_EXECUTE} (`1`) — execution agents
 * - {@link PRIORITY_SPECIFY} (`0`) — specification/triage agents (lowest, default)
 *
 * The limit is read dynamically at `acquire()` time via a getter callback, so
 * live changes to `settings.maxConcurrent` take effect on the next acquire
 * without restarting the engine. Reducing the limit below the current
 * `activeCount` does not evict running agents — it simply blocks new acquires
 * until enough releases bring the active count below the new limit.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const sem = new AgentSemaphore(() => store.getSettings().then(s => s.maxConcurrent));
 * await sem.run(async () => {
 *   // at most maxConcurrent agents run this block concurrently
 * }, PRIORITY_EXECUTE);
 * ```

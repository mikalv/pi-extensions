# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 0.8.4 - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- Compact map and list results render as one syntax-highlighted line again. Width truncation happens before highlighting so the ellipsis cannot reset the tool-card background.

## 0.8.3 - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- Compact eval previews are truncated as plain text before syntax highlighting so they remain one line without ANSI resets breaking the tool-card background.

## 0.8.2 - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Added an installed npm-artifact smoke that packs, installs, starts the bundled bridge, and evaluates code in the fixture project. Hex package checks now require the target bootstrap, and release-note extraction uses a Markdown AST with regression tests.
- Added a real BEAM supervision tree for core services, supervised ownership for lazy services, an outbound transport boundary, and an enforceable Reach architecture policy.
- Added runtime decoding for discriminated stdio messages instead of casting arbitrary parsed JSON to an all-optional TypeScript interface.

### Changed

- Split QuackDB configuration, schema, and resource startup from the mirror plugin, split web-document rendering from the general output renderer, and replaced generated-title/inspected-key heuristics with typed tree metadata.
- Separated output protocol declarations from built-in implementations while preserving the published `Pi.Output` and `Pi.Output.Renderable` contracts and eliminating the final BEAM dependency cycle.
- Target-runtime source now lives as one manifest-driven bundle under application `priv` and resolves through `Application.app_dir/2` instead of duplicated file lists and a compile-time absolute source root.
- The publish workflow now publishes HexDocs and creates the matching GitHub Release from the canonical changelog section.

### Fixed

- Hex packages now include `priv/target/bootstrap.exs` and other runtime files required by target eval.
- Embedded stdio exits cleanly when its owning process closes stdin instead of leaving an orphaned `mix run --no-halt` VM.
- Compact eval previews retain Elixir syntax highlighting before width truncation, and release-note validation distinguishes branch CI runs from version tags.
- Elixir AST tools now explicitly distinguish valid-Elixir ExAST syntax from ast-grep syntax and reject `$NAME`/`$$$ARGS` patterns with actionable guidance before dispatch.
- QuackDB initialization is deferred until its first event, hook, or command so optional mirror startup cannot block the bridge ready handshake. Malformed integer settings fall back safely, and automatic ports are selected from an available loopback socket.

## 0.8.1 - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- The npm package now includes the target-worker bootstrap script required by project and application eval. Package validation requires this runtime file so a source-checkout-only smoke cannot hide a broken published artifact.

## 0.8.0 - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Added a persistent dependencyless target-project VM with authenticated loopback transport, per-session stateful eval, sidecar restoration, timeout cancellation, independent restart, and strict capability/bootstrap validation.
- Added explicit eval targets for dependencyless project code, managed application startup, attached distributed runtimes (`PI_ELIXIR_NODE`), and isolated bridge helpers.
- Added structured eval diagnostics for compiler/runtime failures and preserved last-good bindings, compiled artifacts, and loaded BEAM code after failed edits.
- Added bounded arbitrary labels for named AST searches without creating user-controlled runtime atoms.
- Added explicit target-project context for CodeMap, AST, plugin, skill, git, and filesystem operations.
- Added bridge ready build/protocol/capability negotiation with one atomic stale-child replacement before incompatibility is reported.

### Changed

- The bundled bridge is now always the isolated control plane; target projects no longer need `pi_bridge` in `mix.exs`.
- QuackDB mirror ownership now runs through a serialized lifecycle with supervised sync tasks, explicit readiness, deterministic shutdown, concurrent startup safety, and real non-skipped tests. Updated `quackdb` to 0.5.15 and bound its local endpoint explicitly to `127.0.0.1`.
- Status, doctor output, protocol docs, skills, and READMEs now distinguish the control bridge, project worker, managed application, and attached runtime.
- Skills now use flat standard names (`elixir`, `elixir-web`, and `elixir-new-project`) with mutually exclusive scopes and thin entry points that lazily route to focused references. Model guidance routes runtime/docs work to eval and code-shape/refactor work to AST tools first, without a false target-project `ex_ast` dependency requirement.
- Eval target/mode JSON strings are decoded once by `JSONCodec` into canonical enum atoms; internal dispatch no longer accepts duplicate string representations.
- Skill/package validation now uses pi's canonical skill loader and Mix runtime metadata instead of regular-expression parsing of YAML frontmatter or Elixir source. HTML extraction now uses Floki's document parser, and structured renderer/protocol paths consume their typed payloads directly.

### Fixed

- Eval exception formatting no longer masks `throw` or non-exception `exit` reasons such as `:noproc` with a secondary `FunctionClauseError`.
- Project-aware helpers no longer accidentally resolve paths or git operations against the bundled bridge working directory.
- External HTTP bridge discovery matches structured `project_root` identity instead of extracting `app:` from `mix.exs` with a regular expression.
- Project-local plugins and executable skills are discovered from the explicit target root while the control bridge remains isolated.
- `CodeMap.smells(path: ...)` now normalizes Reach `location` fields into file/line data, removes leading colons from kinds, and prioritizes high-impact/high-confidence findings before applying the default limit.
- Compact project/application/runtime eval renders a bounded one-line inspect preview instead of the first pretty-printed token such as `%{`.
- Cold-start, unavailable, and incompatible bridge failures now persist as real tool errors instead of being downgraded by pi-agent-core's extension-tool result lifecycle. Cold target startup gets its full startup allowance outside the per-eval timeout, and workers inherit the active Mix environment instead of assuming `dev`.
- Attached-runtime startup now ensures `epmd` is running before starting local distribution, including on clean CI hosts.
- QuackDB startup no longer advertises a `localhost` endpoint that has no listening socket, and failed schema startup now cleans up partially started resources.

### Removed

- Removed `/elixir:install`, automatic `mix.exs` mutation, project dependency prompts, installer rollback/network paths, and the legacy fixture dependency on `pi_bridge`.
- Removed legacy stdio readiness-marker fallback; embedded startup now requires the structured ready handshake.

## 0.7.1 - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- Published npm installs now run `mix deps.get` for the bundled isolated bridge before starting embedded stdio, so first use no longer fails with missing bundled bridge dependencies. The integration smoke test starts the bridge in the already-compiled test Mix environment instead of masking cold-start problems with a longer timeout.
- The npm package now includes `packages/bridge/mix.lock` so bundled bridge dependency resolution is reproducible.

## 0.7.0 - 2026-07-06

### Changed

- Elixir tools now start the bundled `pi_bridge` in an isolated bridge VM by default instead of installing `pi_bridge` into target projects. Project eval runs in a separate target-project VM, while `target: "bridge"` keeps pi-elixir helper evals such as `CodeMap`, `AST`, `Self`, `Q`, and `Docs` in the bridge VM.
- Eval inspect/code output now carries Lumis scope metadata with rainbow brackets so pi renderers can apply syntax highlighting using pi theme colors.
- Loosened the `pi_bridge` Mix project (and the bundled `packages/fixtures/demo_project` fixture) `elixir:` requirement from `~> 1.20` to `~> 1.16` so legacy projects on Elixir 1.16–1.19 can adopt the bridge. New-project guidance and startup notices still recommend Elixir 1.20+ / OTP 27+ for the compiler's set-theoretic type-system improvements. The bridge now depends on `json_codec ~> 0.1.5`, which carries the same loosened Elixir requirement.

## 0.6.21 - 2026-06-14

### Changed

- Removed optional project integration discovery/status modules. Project-specific Phoenix/Ecto/Oban/Volt/Iconify checks now live as explicit eval recommendations in skills instead of status-bar metadata.

## 0.6.20 - 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- Added missing `dedent` dependency to the published `package.json` so the extension loads after `pi install npm:pi-elixir`. The inner workspace already declared it; the root manifest did not, so the published tarball shipped without it and `helpers.ts` failed with `Cannot find module 'dedent'`.

## 0.6.19 - 2026-06-13

### Added

- Added `AST.diff(changed: true)` / `Pi.AST.diff/1` for syntax-aware review of Elixir git changes before reading textual patches.
- `elixir_ast_replace` dry-runs now include ExAST semantic edit summaries alongside textual patch details.

### Changed

- Elixir agent guidance now prefers semantic diffs for Elixir code review before large or truncated `git diff` output.
- Elixir syntax diff output now groups evidence by file/module and separates public API edits from private helper changes.

## 0.6.18 - 2026-06-13

### Added

- Added shared extension primitives copied from `dot-pi` as a staging point for a future shared library.
- Elixir tools can now fall back to the bundled `pi_bridge` project using Pi tool provenance when no Mix project is active.
- Added concise `/elixir:status` bridge diagnostics.
- Added minimal Enum-friendly docs helpers: `Pi.Docs.entries/1` and `Pi.Docs.get/3`.

### Changed

- Embedded BEAM startup now streams Mix stdout progress and waits longer for cold compilation.
- Mix child processes use user-local Mix state to avoid system install permission issues.
- BEAM bridge startup guidance is clearer, delayed for warm calls, and rendered as compact status output.
- CodeMap reflection output now leads with a plain recommendation summary and keeps the full evidence tree behind expansion.
- Skill and README docs now prefer `h/1`, `exports/1`, `Pi.Docs.entries/1`, and `Pi.Docs.get/3` over raw docs tuple handling.

### Fixed

- Embedded BEAM children no longer keep `pi --print` sessions alive after tool completion.
- Expanded eval/tree output is clamped to terminal width to avoid TUI render crashes.

## 0.6.17 - 2026-06-13

### Changed

- Dependency-shipped skill discovery now avoids duplicate source/build paths for already-loaded dependency apps.

## 0.6.16 - 2026-06-13

### Changed

- Bridge installation progress now streams a bash-like `mix deps.get` transcript during tool-triggered setup.
- Install transcript rendering now uses command-output previews with expansion hints and elapsed/took timing.
- If the BEAM is still compiling after install, the tool result preserves the install transcript alongside startup guidance.

## 0.6.15 - 2026-06-13

### Added

- Discover executable skills shipped by dependency packages under app `priv/skills` directories.
- Added webdev skill guidance for integration health checks and optional PhoenixTestPlaywright browser acceptance tests.
- Added integration coverage for installer progress, rollback, and Hex network failures.

### Changed

- Bridge installation now streams `mix deps.get` progress and rolls back `mix.exs` if dependency fetching fails.
- Hex network failures during bridge install now include retry guidance.

## 0.6.14 - 2026-06-13

### Added

- Added an `elixir-webdev` skill for Phoenix/LiveView UI workflows, Volt feedback loops, replay debugging, and UI verification.
- Added Volt, PhoenixReplay, and PhoenixIconify integration status badges.

### Changed

- Updated new-project guidance for Phoenix + Igniter + VibeKit apps with Volt, PhoenixReplay, and PhoenixIconify setup.

## 0.6.13 - 2026-06-12

### Changed

- Elixir tools now wait briefly for an embedded BEAM that is still starting before returning the compiling guidance.
- Reduced optional compile warning noise for ReqLLM and Reach/Makeup integrations.

## 0.6.12 - 2026-06-12

### Changed

- Automatic `pi_bridge` installs now default `mix deps.get` to `HEX_HTTP_CONCURRENCY=1` to reduce first-run Hex fetch flakiness while preserving explicit user settings.

## 0.6.11 - 2026-06-12

### Added

- Non-interactive Elixir tool calls can install the dev-only `pi_bridge` dependency automatically, with `PI_ELIXIR_AUTO_INSTALL=0` as an opt-out.
- `Pi.CodeMap.context/2` now returns module-level context for module targets, including macro-heavy modules such as Phoenix routers.

## 0.6.10 - 2026-06-12

### Changed

- Updated the bridge lockfile to Reach 2.7.4 so module-only CodeMap context requests fail gracefully instead of crashing in Reach target resolution.
- Updated ExDNA to 1.5.3 and extracted shared eval output helpers to keep the strict clone budget at zero.

## 0.6.9 - 2026-06-12

### Added

- Documented the recommended project stack: Phoenix + Igniter + VibeKit for web apps, and Igniter + VibeKit for other Elixir projects.

### Fixed

- Structured tree output now handles nested structs, fixing `Self.status()` rendering when bridge plugin commands are present.

## 0.6.8 - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- Avoid stale extension context crashes from late embedded startup notices after session replacement or shutdown.

## 0.6.7 - 2026-06-12

### Added

- `/elixir:doctor` and `/elixir:install` commands for setup diagnostics and explicit per-project bridge installation.
- Manual tmux/asciinema setup-flow coverage for non-Mix directories, missing bridge dependency, wrong Elixir startup failures, happy path tools, and duplicate package conflicts.

### Changed

- Local dogfood install now removes the published npm package first to avoid duplicate tool registration.
- QuackDB mirror defaults to `localhost` for the client URI to match the server endpoint.

### Fixed

- Embedded stdio tool dispatch now returns logged error results for BEAM-side crashes instead of silently timing out.
- Embedded startup failures now surface stderr in doctor output and clear stale unavailable state after successful restarts.
- Integration smoke avoids unnecessary `mix deps.get` when fixture dependencies are already present.

## 0.6.6 - 2026-06-11

### Added

- Reach-backed `Pi.CodeMap` / preloaded `CodeMap` for semantic project maps, target context, callers/callees, smells, and post-edit `CodeMap.reflect/1` workflows.
- Supervised BEAM agent jobs via `Pi.Agent.start/2`, `Pi.Agent.await/2`, `Pi.Agent.result/1`, `Pi.Agent.cancel/1`, and `Pi.Agent.run_many/2`.
- Parent-visible BEAM agent job lifecycle events in session snapshots and the extension session renderer.
- Lightweight embedded stdio integration smoke in the default release gate.

### Changed

- Split host pi session RPC helpers into `Pi.Host`, keeping `Pi.Session` focused on BEAM runtime sessions.
- Switched ReqLLM examples and helpers to `Pi.ReqLLM.current_model/0` instead of the legacy `"pi:current"` string.
- Split extension renderers by domain while keeping the existing renderer barrel for compatibility.
- Elixir development guidance now requires `CodeMap.reflect(changed: true)` after non-trivial Elixir edits when Reach is available.

### Fixed

- Preserved labels for named Elixir AST searches across the JSON boundary.
- Captured automatic `mix deps.get` output and surfaced it only on failure instead of leaking install noise into the TUI.
- Hardened Elixir tool availability outside Mix projects and when Elixir/Mix is missing from `PATH`.
- Added abort cleanup and a hard timeout for embedded BEAM tool calls so stuck calls do not hang forever.
- Precompiled the fixture project in the stdio smoke setup so cold CI compile time is not counted as bridge startup time.

## 0.6.5 - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Eval self-introspection facade via `Pi.Self` / preloaded `Self` with bridge status, eval bindings, QuackDB mirror status, active sessions, plugin/skill inventory, and session-history recall helpers.
- `Pi.Quack.status/0` for compact QuackDB mirror counts and database metadata.
- Documentation and skill prompts for `Self.status/0`, `Self.quack/0`, `Self.bindings/0`, `Self.sessions/0`, and `Self.context/2`.

## 0.6.4 - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Structured eval output helpers: `Pi.table/2`, `Pi.tree/2`, `Pi.code/3`, `Pi.text/2`, and `Pi.Output`.
- Automatic pi-native eval rendering for list-of-map tables and map trees.
- Humane dogfood reload commands: `/elixir:restart` and `/elixir:refresh`.
- Eval-callable development helpers via `Pi.Dev` / `Dev`: `status/0`, `compile/1`, `reload/1`, `loaded/1`, `restart/1`, and `refresh/1`.
- Embedded stdio integration coverage for `Dev.status/0`, `Dev.compile/0`, and typed eval file pipelines.

### Changed

- Elixir skill guidance now frames `elixir_eval` as a typed Elixir shell for runtime, docs, and structured file workflows.

## 0.6.3 - 2026-06-10

### Changed

- Keep the Elixir/BEAM connection footer quiet during healthy or background startup states.
- Report Elixir setup failures as session-history notices instead of persistent footer status.
- Read the extension package version from disk at runtime to avoid stale JSON import cache after dogfood reloads.

### Fixed

- Incompatible `pi_bridge` dependency errors now remain native tool errors so pi renders the tool block with the error background.

## 0.6.2 - 2026-06-10

### Changed

- Release from the configured npm trusted publisher workflow so npm and Hex versions are aligned again.

## 0.6.1 - 2026-06-10

### Changed

- Publish workflow now relies on npm trusted publishing instead of passing an empty npm auth token.

### Fixed

- Eval error rendering now uses structured BEAM exception metadata for compact inline origins and expanded stack frames.
- `elixir_eval` failures now reliably drive pi's native tool error state.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Stateful Livebook-style `elixir_eval` sessions with persisted sidecar snapshots for bindings and eval environment across pi resume/branch navigation.
- Eval state helpers: `Pi.Eval.bindings/0,1`, `Pi.Eval.reset/0,1`, and `Pi.Eval.forget/1,2`.
- First-class ExAST dependency for structural Elixir search and rewrite tools.
- BEAM/extension feature flags for stateful eval, eval sidecars, LLM bridge requests, BEAM sessions, plugins, executable skills, and compact eval previews.
- `Pi.Features.gate/2` DSL for BEAM-side feature-gated code paths.

### Changed

- README and package docs now position stdio as the default transport and `PI_MCP_URL` as an advanced/debug escape hatch.
- Docs now explicitly describe pi-owned LLM handling with `Pi.ReqLLM` as an adapter over pi's active model path.
- Normal JS unit tests exclude integration tests; `pnpm --dir packages/extension run test:integration` runs embedded stdio/MCP integration tests explicitly.
- Repository metadata and docs now point to `elixir-vibe/pi-elixir`.
- Elixir development skill guidance now strongly prefers ExAST for Elixir code-shape search/refactors and BEAM docs APIs for installed module/function docs.

### Fixed

- Eval sidecar restore now uses safe binary decoding with a reduced safe snapshot representation instead of deserializing raw `Macro.Env` terms.
- Added regression coverage for restoring eval sidecar snapshots after evaluator restart.

## 0.5.4 - 2026-06-09

### Added

- BEAM session snapshots now carry activity metadata including last activity time, current activity start time, and turn count.
- BEAM session trees now show token/cost usage summaries and recursive nested child status aggregation.
- Added TUI/session debugging workflow notes for monitored tmux/asciinema playground runs.

### Changed

- Elixir tool call previews normalize multiline arguments into a single pi-style preview line.
- Completed BEAM session trees remain transcript-first while live/running snapshots stay widget-only.

### Fixed

- Removed repeated live `elixir-sessions` transcript entries that caused TUI artifacts during subagent startup.
- Fixed nested BEAM session summary branch alignment in compact trees.

## 0.5.3 - 2026-06-09

### Changed

- Improved extension import readability with runtime-safe `#src/*` package import aliases.

## 0.5.2 - 2026-06-09

### Added

- BEAM `llm_stream` routing through pi's active model with `llm_chunk`, `llm_done`, and `llm_error` delivery.
- Version alignment enforcement between the npm extension and installed `pi_bridge`; mismatches now tell users exactly which Mix dependency to install.
- Hex package build validation in the strict release gate.

### Changed

- Pi BEAM install prompts now prefer exact Hex dependencies like `{:pi_bridge, "== 0.5.2", only: :dev}` instead of leaking local checkout paths.
- BEAM session trees are width-aware and parallel child sessions use meaningful child labels.

### Fixed

- `pi_bridge` startup info now reports the bridge application version rather than the consuming Mix project version.

## 0.5.1 - 2026-06-09

### Added

- Hidden `/elixir:debug` command that writes a snapshot-style diagnostic dump to `~/.pi/agent/pi-elixir-debug.log`, following pi core's debugging style.
- `PI_ELIXIR_DEBUG=1|debug|verbose` responsiveness diagnostics, including automatic event-loop lag snapshots during active turns and optional verbose diagnostic values.
- Diagnostic timing spans for lifecycle hooks, connection resolution, embedded BEAM startup/ready/error/exit, bridge request handlers, plugin tool hooks, tool calls, and executable skill discovery/materialization.

### Changed

- Mix project resolution no longer recursively scans arbitrary nested directories from broad working directories; it now only accepts the current `mix.exs` or known bundled `packages/bridge/mix.exs` layout.

### Fixed

- Avoided extension hot-path filesystem traversal that could stall pi's Node event loop and delay interrupt handling when pi was launched from broad monorepo roots such as `~/Development`.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-06-09

### Added

- Root-level pnpm workspace/npm package metadata and pack validation so `pnpm pack` includes both the TypeScript extension and bundled `packages/bridge` sources without custom copy scripts.
- Strict JSONCodec protocol structs for stdio, MCP, LLM, API inventory, bridge info, integration status, and plugin/skill metadata.
- Namespaced protocol families: `Pi.Protocol.API.*`, `Pi.Protocol.MCP.*`, `Pi.Protocol.LLM.*`, and `Pi.Protocol.Integration.*`.
- `Pi.LLM` complete/stream APIs over the active pi stdio session.
- ReqLLM adapter/provider route for `pi:current`.
- `Pi.Agent.Run` for structured chain/parallel/fanout orchestration results.
- `Pi.Agent.Messages` normalization using `Pi.Protocol.LLM.Message`.
- Supervised plugin lifecycle with `Pi.Plugin.Supervisor`, `Pi.Plugin.Manager`, and isolated `Pi.Plugin.Worker` processes.
- Vibe-inspired plugin API macro, default API aliases, dynamic load/unload, shutdown callback, and `Pi.Plugin.Waiters`.
- Dune-backed `Pi.Eval.Sandbox`, `Pi.Eval.sandbox/2`, and `elixir_sandbox_eval` for restricted untrusted Elixir snippets.
- BEAM-to-pi event bus publishing with `Pi.Plugin.Event.emit/2`.
- BEAM plugin slash commands exposed as `/elixir:<name>` commands.
- BEAM session APIs for info, active tools, append-entry persistence, and visible custom transcript messages.
- Plugin `tool_call/3` and `tool_result/3` hooks for blocking or patching tool execution.
- Dedicated `elixir-new-project` skill for Igniter/VibeKit project bootstrapping.
- Executable skill and plugin examples plus a demo fixture Mix project.
- Extension-owned stdio smoke tests covering ready info, LLM completion, and streaming.
- Protocol JSON examples in `packages/bridge/docs/protocol.md` with tests covering the documented shapes.
- Transcript-first OTP session rendering with compact/expanded BEAM session trees, edge-state handling, and live streaming previews.

### Changed

- Bridge internals now prefer structs over ad-hoc protocol maps.
- Tests now mirror source tree structure more closely.
- Extension TypeScript protocol shapes now live in `src/protocol/types.ts`.
- Extension session code is split under `src/sessions/*` and bridge helpers under `src/bridge/*`, including plugin tool hook handling.
- Integration tests default to `packages/fixtures/demo_project` instead of the bridge package itself.
- Elixir skills are organized under `skills/elixir/*` while keeping stable skill names.
- `Pi.Protocol.Session.Snapshot` now includes prompt/response previews, run count, completion time, current activity, and recent output fields; streaming snapshots report `current: "streaming"` while output is arriving.
- `Pi.Session.append_entry/3` and `send_message/3` now accept keyword data for ergonomic Elixir call sites.

### Fixed

- Mix projects without `:pi_bridge` are now shown as `BEAM tools missing` instead of starting a doomed embedded BEAM and getting stuck offline.
- Monorepo roots such as `pi-elixir` now resolve nested Mix projects for BEAM status and tools.
- `elixir_eval` exceptions now return tool errors instead of successful text payloads.
- AST tool scripts now report missing `ex_ast` as normal tool output instead of eval exceptions.
- LLM stream completion now halts immediately on `llm_done` instead of timing out.
- Stdio stream events are routed through `Pi.LLM.Broker` to the stream owner process.
- Malformed stdio protocol payloads are ignored without crashing the transport loop.
